# Hate-Crime Data Challenge

This was a data project I did where I took some hate crime data from the FBI database from 1991- 2020 and using more data like median salary per state, population size, unemployment rate and education level and see if hate crimes are tied to these factors

❗This shows the joins I made across the 4 tables to be able to create one large table to upload into PowerBI for analysis

❗I chose a year to focus on and created a dashboard to answer some of the questions I came up with to push my analysis. Using different visuals like maps and bar charts to show the answers I got from the data

❗To further confirm that my findings were accurate, I ran a linear regression on the data
